# 🔐 Password Validator

A simple password validation tool built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
It provides real-time feedback to help users create strong and secure passwords.

## 📚 About This Project

This project was built by following an in-depth tutorial focused on password validation using JavaScript.

Some parts of the tutorial were challenging for me, especially because I encountered new JavaScript concepts I hadn’t used before.  
However, working through the project helped me better understand important programming logic and improve my JS skills significantly.

It turned out to be a great learning experience, and by the end of it, I felt much more confident handling dynamic form validation and DOM manipulation.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Real-time input validation with JavaScript
- Working with regular expressions
- Better handling of user interactions via the DOM
- Creating clean and responsive UI with CSS
